# [](#summary)SUMMARY

I’m a Linux enthusiast and Web Developer focusing on Bootstrap and static  
sites. I can also do some system administration.

In my free time I tinker with Arduino and Raspberry Pi (small Linux board),  
doing various small automation projects, and thinking of ways to use  
technology to improve life.

# [](#options)OPTIONS

**—enthusiast**  
I started using Ubuntu Linux in late 2011 and felt right at home, learning  
the in’s and out’s of the terminal, package management and system  
configuration as fast as I could take it in.

**—web designer|developer**  
As an amature Web Designer I am passionate about clarity and ease of use for  
the user. I use Twitter Bootstrap for rapid development and cross device  
compatibility.

As a developer I strive to make fast static sites using Jekyll, have  
developement be easy to follow by using GIT (distributed version control  
system) and constantly evaluating new solutions to improve my work.

**—student**  
Constantly teaching myself new things, learning about new tech: hardware and  
software. I’ve dabbled with bash scripting, GoLang, python but nothing serious.

**—other**  
In a past life I was a self taught guitarist then drummer in a short lived  
local rock band. I engineered, recorded and mixed several songs and practice  
sessions; giving me the opportunity to make money on the side recording  
amature musicians and producing cds.
